# This defines common bin directories
# on mac and linux to put onto the $PATH

# On Linux, this is sourced at the beginning
# of the X session, from /etc/lightdm/Xsession,
# so it is available to all
# applications. To update after modifying,
# the xsession has to be restarted:
# sudo systemctl restart lightdm

# On Mac, this is sourced in zsh setup,
# near the beginning in $ZDOTDIR/env_config.zsh
# My personal/package bin directories are put
# before the GNU-libexec dirs, and before the system PATH
