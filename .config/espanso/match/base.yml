# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  - trigger: "makes sense"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: random
        params:
          choices:
            - "makes sense"
            - "got it"
            - "i see"
            - "understood"
            - "gotcha"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!
