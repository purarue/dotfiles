# See https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd/blob/master/examples/skhdrc for more examples
# Use shkd to bind applications to cmd + alt
# This shouldn't interfere with window manager commands (https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst)
# since those are prefixed with option + shift or ctrl + option + shift

cmd + alt - return : kitty -d=~ -1
cmd + alt - f : /Applications/Firefox\ Developer\ Edition.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
