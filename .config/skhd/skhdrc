# Mac keyboard hotkey daemon
# See https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd/blob/master/examples/skhdrc for more examples
# Use shkd to bind applications to cmd + alt
# This shouldn't interfere with window manager commands (https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst)
# since those are prefixed with option + shift or ctrl + option + shift

cmd + alt - return : ~/.local/scripts/mac/mac-alacritty -e tmux
#cmd + alt - h : ~/.local/scripts/mac/mac-alacritty -e htop
