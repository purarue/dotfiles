This is a pretty personal script, it uses my dev environment
requires:
python packages:
    httpx
    toml
commands:
    notify-send
    wait-for-internet (https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/wait-for-internet)

Waits till I have an internet connection, and then
checks whether the the server and the correct
amount of processes are running (and dont seem to be
stuck restarting)

Expects a toml file at $ZDOTDIR/secrets that contains:

FOREVER_LIST_TOKEN # token to communicate with the HTTP server
FOREVER_LIST_COUNT # number of expected running processes
